# volume-monitor-demo

An easy volume indicator, monitoring the volume(mount)/drive's added(mount) or removed(unmount).
It provides an Pallet interaction Mode. Authough it monitors many kind of states, only the edjectable mount will be processed.
For example, when a udisk's device has mounted, it will show a messeage and tray icon in indicator, and you can do some simple works on those.
